## 🧠 Why NeuroAssistAI?

Medical professionals spend hours analyzing brain scans.  
**NeuroAssistAI** aims to reduce the diagnostic load by performing:

🔍 **Stage 1:** Detect if a brain tumor exists and classify it  
🧪 **Stage 2:** If Glioma → Predict its medical stage (I–IV) using gene mutation data

> A smart, responsive AI pipeline — built to assist, not replace.

## 🔧 System in Action

### 👁️‍🗨️ Tumor Classification

- 🎯 Input: Grayscale MRI image
- 🧠 Model: Custom CNN in PyTorch
- 🎯 Output: One of `No Tumor`, `Pituitary`, `Meningioma`, `Glioma`

### 🧬 Glioma Stage Prediction

- 📄 Input: Gene mutation test results (numerical)
- 🔗 Model: ANN with ReLU layers
- 📈 Output: Stage I, II, III, or IV
